        # what is react?

        * The v in mvc
        * developed by facebook and open-sourced

        ---

        # when to use react?

        * for dynamic sites
        * if you want to use vanilla JS and ES6, rather than learn a new DSL (domain specific language)

        ---

        # getting started with jsx

          * what is jsx
            * JSX allows us to describe our User Interfaces (UIs) in a syntax very similar to the HTML
            * it is optional
            * JSX provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(component, props, ...children) function
            * you can catch more template errors at compile time, rather than on page load
            * Making smaller, reusable components is also easier
            * [jsx](https://jsx.github.io/)

          * why is jsx
            * key - React asks for a key attribute that points to a unique ID for each list element
              * To optimize list display performance
            * Synthetic events - Some event handlers (onSubmit, onClick) have different names or implementations in different browsers.
              * The HTML created by your code will be browser specific-  simplifying cross browser compatibility.

        ## Transpiling
          * babel to transpile it to the supported JavaScript that the browser will understand.
          * babel can convert the code from ES6 to ES5, this is because not all the browsers can interpret our ES6

        ## Virtual DOM
          * the virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI
            is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
          * updating the DOM requires browser manipulation, which is slow
            * updating the virtual DOM does not change the browser (making it faster)

        ---
        # behind the sceans

        ## javascript class

        * a class is a new Javascript feature, added in ES6 (ECMA2015).
        * behaves similarly to classes in object-oriented languages.
        * a class can have a constructor function, which is run on initialization.
        * a class can extend another class with the "extends" keyword.
          * If it does so, it's constructor needs to use the word super().

        # components

        * components are the building blocks of react

        * A function component is the simplest form of a React component
          * It is a simple function with a simple contract
          ```javascript
              const Button = (props) => {
                    return (
                      <button>a simple button</button>
                    );
              }
          ```

        * A class component is a more featured way to define a React component
          * It also acts like a function that receives props, but that function also considers a private internal state
          ```javascript
              class Button extends React.Component {
                  state = { counter: 1 };
                  render() {
                    return (
                      <button>{this.state.counter}</button>
                    );
                  }
                }
          ```

         # code

         * [open the codepen](https://codepen.io/jks8787/pen/YOvZQQ)
         * we have function component and a class component
         ```javascript
             const Hello = () => (
               <h2>Hello World</h2>
             );
         ```
         ```javascript
             class App extends React.Component {
               render() {
                 return (<h1>Greetings Earth</h1>);
               }
             }
         ```
         * we update the DOM, using a diff of the virtual DOM.
          * First argument is new HTML, second is the element to insert it in.
          ```javascript
            ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
          ```
